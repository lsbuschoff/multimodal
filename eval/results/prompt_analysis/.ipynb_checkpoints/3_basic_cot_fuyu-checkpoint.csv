The astronauts are exploring planets with alien terrains depicted with different colours and textures. Each astronaut has different skills, making each terrain more or less exhausting or easy for them to cross. All astronauts can ultimately cross all terrains, even if it's exhausting. The astronauts land far from the base and have to walk there. In each image, the black circle on the left indicates where the astronaut landed. The base is on the middle right part of the image. Sometimes care packages are dropped from above and the astronauts can pick them up. There are two kinds of care packages depicted with an orange cylinder and a white cube. Each astronaut has different preferences and likes each kind of care package in different amounts. The astronauts don't actually need the care packages. They can go straight to the base, or they can pick one up. You will see images of different astronauts with different skills and preferences travelling from their landing location to the home base. The astronauts always have a map. So they know all about the terrains and the care packages.Answer the following question and give your reasoning why: How much does the astronaut like the orange care package on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (a lot)? Let's think step by step and then give your final answer as a single number in the format [X].\x04\n\nThe astronauts enjoy the orange care package a lot, as it aligns with their preferences.\n1|ENDOFTEXT|""]"
