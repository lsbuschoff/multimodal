But, because these goals are in conflict with each other, they are often opposed. For example, in the case described above, the physical goal (reach the star) is achieved by moving alone. The social goal (help or hinder) is intended to be achieved through interaction with the second agent (BLUE). However, because of the conflict between their goals, they may decide to interact in a way that ultimately hinders their physical goal or helps it, depending on their strategy."

If an agent fails to achieve its goal, it is considered lost. Since both agents have social goals, in addition to physical goals, a score is assigned to each agent based on their performance with respect to their physical and social goals. A higher score is better."
